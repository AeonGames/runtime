# AeonGames Runtime
cmake based open source run-time enviroment

# Introduction
The AeonGames Runtime is a collection of CMake scripts that build an assortment of open source tools and libraries in order to be used as dependencies for other projects.
This is most useful on Windows as most Linux distributions already contain development libraries for most open source projects.

# Dependencies
Other than cmake, a compiler and maybe an IDE of your choise, Git must be installed in such a way that it can be detected by cmake.

# Included Packages
- zlib 1.2.8
- libpng 1.6.18
- freetype 2.6
